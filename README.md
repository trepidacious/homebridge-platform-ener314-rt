[Energenie Pi-mote](https://energenie4u.co.uk/catalogue/product/ENER314) plugin for the [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) project based on [homebridge-platform-rcswitch](https://github.com/rainlake/homebridge-platform-rcswitch).

# Installation

1. Install [energenie](http://pythonhosted.org/energenie/#installation)
2. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
3. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-platform-energenie`
4. Update your configuration file. See the sample below.

# Configuration

Configuration sample:

`delay` is the time in milliseconds between each command. As Pi-mote can only send one command at the time, this allows things like scenes with multiple commands to work by queueing the commands.

`switches` is the list of the commands to send for turning sockets on/off.

Note: Some sockets may respond only to `on` commands and turning on/off is done by using different socket id (usually when `n` is for on then `n+1` is for off).
